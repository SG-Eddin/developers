# Requesting Transactions
## Send Users An Ethereum Transaction Request for Your Web3 dApp

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how you can create and send an Ethereum transaction request to your users using the uPort Connect library.

uPort Connect is the client-side library that allows you to interact with a user's uPort identity through a uPort client, primarily the mobile app. It handles the communication channel between your app and a uPort client; this communication channel is used to send requests for a user's data, and for sharing credentials. This library offers the default quick start implementation for integrating uPort.

If you are using uPort Connect (instead of creating your solution using uPort Credentials + uPort Transports), then this login tutorial is written for you. To integrate this solution into your dApp, youâ€™ll need to:

* Clone the [uPort Connect](https://github.com/uport-project/uport-connect) repository locally
* Download the uPort Mobile app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uportMobile&hl=en_US) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uport-id/id1123434510?mt=8))

We'll cover these and more in the next section.
