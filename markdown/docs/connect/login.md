# Web3 Login Solution
## Build a Secure Login Solution for Your web3 Application

* Login a user
* Keep a user logged in
* QR code scan
* Compatible with your Web3 dApp

uPort Connect is the client-side library that allows you to interact with a user's uPort identity through a uPort client, primarily the mobile app. It handles the communication channel between your app and a uPort client; this communication channel is used to send requests for a user's data, and to share credentials. This library offers the default quick start implementation to integrate with uPort. 

If you are using uPort Connect (instead of creating your own solution using uPort Credentials + uPort Transports), then this login tutorial is written for you, as it will help you build a login solution for your Web3 app. To integrate this solution into your dApp, youâ€™ll need to:

* Clone the uPort Connect repository locally
* Download the uPort Mobile app (Android | iOS)

We'll cover these and more in the next section.
