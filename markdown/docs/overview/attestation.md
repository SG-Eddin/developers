# Issue Verifications
## Contribute to the Decentralized World

Identity is one of the most significant barriers to entry into the decentralized world. As a result, having trust anchors and dApps that can issue verifications to users credentials are crucial.

It’s not enough for people to make self-made claims about who they are. This is in part because they might make false claims if there is an incentive for them to do so (e.g., underage drinking), and in part due to their claims lacking any regulatory standing — unless they are attested (e.g., participating in city elections).

As a developer, not only can you request verified credentials from your users, but uPort is also designed to handle issuing verifications. Users can share these credential across a growing network of integrated applications and start building a strong identiy, which will unlock other decentralized services to them. The ability to issue verifications helps bridge the gap between web 2.0 and web 3.0, making the transition to the decentralized world frictionless. 

* Server-side dApp

If you’re building a server-side app using uPort Credential + uPorts Transports, then this is the appropriate solution for you.
