# Issue Verifications
## Contribute to the Decentralized World

Identity is one of the most significant barriers to entry into the decentralized world. As a result, having trust anchors and dApps that can issue verifications to user’s credentials are crucial.

It’s not enough for people to make self-made claims about who they are. This is in part because they might make false claims if there is an incentive for them to do so (e.g., underage drinking), and in part due to their claims lacking any regulatory standing — unless they are attested (e.g., participating in city elections).

As a developer, not only can you request verified credentials from your users, but uPort is also designed to handle issuing verifications. Users can use these credential across a growing network of integrated applications and begin to build strong identities, which will unlock other decentralized services. The ability to issue verifications helps bridge the gap between web 2.0 and web 3.0, making the transition to the decentralized world frictionless. 

In this section, we cover how you can issue verifications to your users.
