# Issue Verifications
## Contribute to the Decentralized World

Identity is one of the most significant barriers to entry into the decentralized world. As a result, trust anchors that have the ability to issue verifications to user’s credentials are crucial.

It’s not enough for people to make self-made claims about who they are. This is in part because they might make false claims if there is an incentive for them to do so (e.g., underage drinking), and in part due to their claims lacking any regulatory standing — unless they are attested (e.g., participating in city elections).

As a developer, not only can you request verified credentials from your users, but uPort is also designed to handle attesting user credentials, making the transition to the decentralized world frictionless.

In this section, we have tailored multiple solutions to meet your needs, pick from one of the following to continue:

* Server Attestation
* Web3 Attestation
