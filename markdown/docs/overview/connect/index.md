# Login Solutions

## Frictionless Login Across the Web 

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows people to use their digital identity wherever they go on the web. Instead of creating a new identity and credential for each account, users will use their uPort identity to access their accounts across the web.

The concept of bring your own identity is increasingly more commonplace; this is an excellent news for you as a developer. Up until now, you had two option. The first one was to ask users to fill-out multiple pages of information about themselves, which was then stored in a vulnerable centralized database. Your other option was to use centralized authentication systems; however, as we witnessed with the Facebook hack, that’s not an ideal solution either.

By using uPort, you will provide your users with the comfort of not having to remember their credentials — gone are the days of resetting usernames and passwords — dApps will verify their identity using unbreakable key pairs. Even better yet, your users will be the owners of their own identity, and as a result, you don’t have to sacrifice security to reduce friction.

Our tutorials have been tailored based on the type of solution you seek, the following are the main two categories:


* Server login
  * If you’re building a server-side app using uPort Credential + uPorts Transports, then this is the appropriate solution for you.
* Web3 login
  * If you’re building your app using uPort Connect; the default, quick start implementation to integrate with uPort, then this is the appropriate solution for you.
